Blog website

Blogs allow us to express out knowledge in concise way. I cannot forget the number of times I have read the Medium blogs to get an introductory understanding of some concepts. This is my attempt at building a blog website which lets users read existing blogs as well as post some of their own.

Technology stack: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, BootStrap, HTML5, CSS.


*This is a rough introduction, I plan to modify and make a more detailed walk through soon.*
